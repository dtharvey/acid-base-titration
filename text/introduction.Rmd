$\require{mhchem}$An acid-base titration is an analytical method in which we react an acidic or a basic analyte---the titrand---with a strong base or a strong acid---the titrant---until they react in a known stoichiometric ratio.   

#### Titration Curves and Visual Indicators

The figure on the upper right is a titration curve for the reaction of HCl with NaOH. It was recorded by placing the NaOH in a buret and slowly adding it to the solution of HCl while monitoring the mixture's pH. As discussed below, a visual indicator---an organic dye, such as methyl red, whose color varies with pH---is often added to the titration mixture. The color of the titration curve shows the change in the indicator's color during the titration. 

#### Equivalence Points and Endpoints

A titration's equivalence point is the pH and volume where the moles of titrand and the moles of titrant are the same. A strong acid, such as HCl, has a pH below 7. As we add a strong base, such as NaOH, the pH increases but remains below 7 if HCl is in excess. The pH rises above 7 when the moles of NaOH exceeds the moles of HCl. When the pH is 7, the moles of NaOH added is the same as the moles of HCl initially present; this is the equivalence point.

If we know the equivalence point's pH, then we can titrate to this pH and record the volume; this is, however, a rare circumstance. Instead, we either continue the titration until the pH levels off and identify the equivalence point as the volume, $V$, where the slope of the titration curve reaches its greatest value, or we use a visual indicator that changes color at a pH close to the equivalence point. The photograph on the lower right, for example, shows the color of methyl red in (a) its red, weak acid form at a pH < 4.2 and (c) its yellow, weak base form at a pH > 6.3. and (b) for pHs values between 4.2 and 6.3 where the indicator is present in both its acid and its base form, and is orange; this is called the titration's endpoint. In a well-designed acid-base titration, the difference between the equivalence point's volume and the endpoint's volume is small.
