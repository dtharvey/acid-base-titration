An acid-base titration is a quantitative analytical method in which we determine the concentration of an acidic or a basic analyte---which we call the titrand---by the controlled addition of a strong base or a strong acid---which we call the titrant---until the acid and the base react in a known stoichiometric ratio.   

#### Titration Curves and Visual Indicators

The figure on the lower right is a titration curve for the reaction of a strong acid titrand, HCl, with a strong base titrant, NaOH. It was recorded by placing the NaOH in a buret and slowly adding it to the solution of HCl while monitoring the titration mixture's pH. As discussed below, a visual indicator---an organic dye, such as methyl red, whose color varies with pH---is often added to the titration mixture. The color of the titration curve shows the indicator's color during the titration. 

#### Equivalence Points and Endpoints

A titration's equivalence point is the pH and volume where the initial moles of titrand is equal to the stoichiometric moles of titrant delivered. The volume of titrant needed to reach the equivalence point is the critical measurement in a titration. A solution of a strong acid, such as HCl, has a pH below 7. As we add a strong base, such as NaOH, the pH increases but remains below 7 if HCl is in excess. The pH rises above 7 when the moles of NaOH added exceeds the moles of HCl. When the pH is 7, the moles of NaOH added is the same as the moles of HCl initially present; this is the equivalence point.

If we know the equivalence point's pH, then we can titrate to this exact pH and record the volume; this is, however, a rare circumstance. Instead, we either continue the titration until the pH levels off and identify the equivalence point as the volume, $V$, where the slope of the titration curve, $\frac{\Delta \text{pH}}{\Delta V}$, reaches its greatest value, or we use a visual indicator that changes color at a pH close to the equivalence point. The photograph on the upper right, for example, shows the color of methyl red in (a) its red, weak acid form at a pH < 4.2 and (c) its yellow, weak base form at a pH > 6.3. For pH levels greater than 4.2, but less than 6.3, the indicator is present in (b) both its acid and its base form, and is orange; this is called the titration's endpoint. In a well-designed acid-base titration, the difference between the equivalence point's volume and the endpoint's volume is small.
