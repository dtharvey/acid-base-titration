<p>The upper panel of controls defines the conditions for the titration
of a strong acid or a strong base titrand using a strong base or a
strong acid titrant. The sliders for concentrations are logarithmic; the
titrand’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} =
0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the titrant’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-0.7} = 0.2 \text{ M}\)</span>. The lower
panel of controls defines the range of volumes to use when displaying
the titration curve and selects the indicator. The color of the
titration curve mimics the indicator’s color during the titration. The
indicator’s endpoint is defined as the average of its acidic and basic
limits.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe how the titrand’s concentration
and volume, and the titrant’s concentration affect the shape and
position of the titration curve along the <em>x</em>-axis. Are the
effects the same when titrating a strong acid and titrating a strong
base?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Which indicators are suitable for the
titration of a strong acid with a strong base when [titrand] = [titrant]
= <span class="math inline">\(0.10\)</span> M? Repeat for the titration
of a strong base with a strong acid.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. When we use an indicator to signal the
endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the
absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration
curve by measuring the pH of the reaction mixture as we add the titrant.
Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the equivalence
point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10<sup>-3</sup> M?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. The monoprotic weak base guanine, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{C5H5N5O}\)</span>, is insoluble in water, but
fully soluble in acid. One way to determine the purity of guanine is to
add a known amount of impure guanine to an excess of HCl and then
determine the amount of unreacted HCl by titrating with a standard
solution of NaOH. This is called a back-titration. Propose a set of
conditions—mass of impure guanine, molarity and volume of HCl, molarity
of NaOH, and acid-base indicator—that will allow you to determine the
purity of guanine. You may assume that the samples are at least 95 %w/w
guanine. All titrations should have endpoints between <span class="math inline">\(20.0\)</span> mL and <span class="math inline">\(40.0\)</span> mL.</p>
