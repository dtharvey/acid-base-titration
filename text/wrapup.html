<h4>Simulating Titration Curves</h4>
<p>The titration curves in this module are calculated using the
<code>titrationCurve</code> package, a set of <code>R</code> functions
for simulating and plotting acid-base titration curves (and metal-ligand
complexation, redox, and precipitation titrations). The calculations use
the general approach outlined in <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/principles-of-quantitative-chemical-analysis/oclc/300033136">R.
de Levie, <em>Principles of Quantitative Analysis</em>, McGraw-Hill,
1997</a>. The package is available through <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/titrationCurves/index.html">CRAN</a>
and through <a href="https://github.com/dtharvey/titrationCurves">GitHub</a>.</p>

<h4>Additional Thoughts on Endpoints</h4>
<p>Identifying the pH of a visual indicator’s endpoint as the average of
its lower pH limit and its upper pH limit, is one of convenience. There
is no precise definition of an indicator’s endpoint because the change
in color is a subjective decision of each analyst. For some visual
indicators, one of its two forms is colorless—phenolphthalein is one
such indicator, with an acid form that is colorless and a base form that
is red—which makes it somewhat easier to detect a change in color and
may shift the endpoint toward the pH where the colorless form
predominates.</p>

<h4>Alternative Ways to Locate Equivalence Points</h4>
<p>When we record a titration curve, the equivalence point is where the
change in pH as a function of volume—the slope of the titration curve—is
greatest. Locating the exact equivalence point in a normal titration
curve is difficult because we are not particularly adept at identifying
the small differences in the slope when the pH is changing rapidly.
Reporting the first-derivative of the titration curve, ∂pH/∂V, solves
this problem, as seen in the figures on the right for the titration of a
diprotic weak acid with NaOH where the equivalence points become sharp
peaks. The equivalence points in both the normal titration curve and the
first derivative titration curve are identified by the two vertical
lines at 25 mL and 50 mL. One limitation to a first derivative titration
curve is that it amplifies any noise in the titration curve, which may
complicate locating the equivalence point.</p>

students to acid-base titrimetry at a level suitable for an introductory
course in analytical chemistry. The app assumes students are comfortable
with stoichiometric calculations. You can access the app through <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fdthdpu.shinyapps.io%2FBeersLaw%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AOvVaw0CPeQJzyvft7D2mOHSaEWB">shinyapps.io</a>
