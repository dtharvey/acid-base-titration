<!-- text for activity 2 -->

The upper panel of controls define the conditions---concentrations and volumes---for the titration of a weak acid or a weak base titrand using a strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK slider to select the strength of the titrand. The sliders for concentration are logarithmic; the titrand's default concentration is $10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}$ and the titrant's default concentration is $10^{-0.7} = 0.2 \text{ M}$. The lower panel of controls defines the range of volumes to use when displaying the titration curve and selects the indicator. The color of the titration curve mimics the indicator's color during the titration. The indicator's endpoint is defined here as the average of its acidic and basic limits.

**Exercise 1**. Describe how the titrand's p$K_a$ or p$K_b$, its concentration and volume, and the titrant's concentration affect the shape and position of the titration curve along the *x*-axis and the change in pH at the equivalence point. Not all combinations of these variables will yield a useful titration curve---it is easy, for example, to overshoot a titration's equivalence point if it requires just a few mL of titrant---so make note of how limitations on one variable may depend on the values of other variable. Are the effects the same when titrating a weak acid and titrating a weak base?

**Exercise 2**. Which indicators are suitable for the titration of a weak acid with a strong base when [titrand] = [titrant] = 0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider range of concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a weak base with a strong acid.

**Exercise 3**. When we use an indicator to signal the endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the equivalence point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10^-3^ M?

**Exercise 4**. Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic acid, $\ce{CH3COOH}$, that typically is 4--8 %w/v. Propose a set of conditions---volume of vinegar, molarity of NaOH, and acid-base indicator---that will allow you to determine the concentration of acetic acid. All titrations should have endpoints between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.
