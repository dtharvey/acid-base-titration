<p>The upper panel of controls define the conditions—concentrations and
volumes—for the titration of a diprotic weak acid or weak base titrand
using a strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK sliders to set
the two pK values for the titrands. The sliders for concentration are
logarithmic; the titrand’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the
titrant’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-0.7}
= 0.2 \text{ M}\)</span>. The lower panel of controls defines the range
of volumes to use when displaying the titration curve and selects the
indicator. The color of the titration curve mimics the indicator’s color
during the titration. The indicator’s endpoint is defined here as the
average of its acidic and basic limits.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe the effect of the titrand’s two
p<span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span> or p<span class="math inline">\(K_b\)</span> values, its concentration and volume,
and the titrant’s concentration on the shape and position of the
titration curve along the <em>x</em>-axis and the change in pH at each
of its two equivalence points. Not all combinations of these variables
will yield a useful titration curve. Are the effects the same when
titrating a diprotic weak acid and titrating a diprotic weak base?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Which indicators are suitable for a
titration of a diprotic weak acid with a strong base using [titrand] =
[titrant] = 0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider
range of concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a diprotic weak
base with a strong acid.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. When we use an indicator to signal the
endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the
absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration
curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the
titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the
equivalence point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10<sup>-3</sup> M?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Commercial washing soda is 30–40 %w/w
<span class="math inline">\(\ce{Na2CO3}\)</span>. Propose a set of
conditions—mass of washing soda, molarity of HCl, and choice of
acid-base indicator—that will allow you to determine the amount of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Na2CO3}\)</span> in samples of washing soda
when using HCl as a titrant. All titrations should have endpoints
between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.</p>
