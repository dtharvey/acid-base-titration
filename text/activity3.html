<p>The upper panel of controls set the conditions—concentrations and
volumes—for the titration of a weak acid or a weak base titrand using a
strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK slider to set the two
pK values for the weak acid or the weak base. The sliders for
concentration are logarithmic; the titrand’s default concentration is
<span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the
titrant’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-0.7}
= 0.2 \text{ M}\)</span>. The lower panel of controls sets the range of
volumes to use when displaying the titration curve and selects the
indicator. The color of the titration curve mimics the indicator’s color
during the titration. The indicator’s endpoint is defined here as the
average of its acidic and basic limits.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe the effect of the titrand’s two
p<span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span> or p<span class="math inline">\(K_b\)</span> values, its concentration and its
volume, and the titrant’s concentration on the shape and position of the
titration curve along the <em>x</em>-axis and the change in pH at each
of its two equivalence points. Not all combinations of these variables
yield a useful titration curve—it is easy, for example, to overshoot a
titration’s equivalence point if it requires just a few mL of titrant—so
make note of how limitations on one variable may depend on the values of
other variable. Are the effects the same when titrating a diprotic weak
acid and titrating a diprotic weak base?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Which indicators are suitable for a
titration of a diprotic weak acid with a strong base using [titrand] =
[titrant] = 0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider
range of concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a diprotic weak
base with a strong acid.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. When we use an indicator to signal the
endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the
absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration
curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the
titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the
equivalence point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10<sup>-3</sup> M?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Commercial washing soda is 30–40 %w/w
<span class="math inline">\(\ce{Na2CO3}\)</span>. Propose a set of
conditions—mass of washing soda, molarity and volume of HCl, and
acid-base indicator—that will allow you to determine the amount of <span class="math inline">\(\ce{Na2CO3}\)</span> in samples of washing soda
when using HCl as a titrant. All titrations should have endpoints
between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.</p>
