titration is an analytical method in which we react an acidic or a basic
analyte—the titrand—with a strong base or a strong acid—the
titrant—until they react in a known stoichiometric ratio.</p>

<h4>Titration Curves and Visual Indicators</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is a titration curve for the reaction
of HCl with NaOH. It was recorded by placing the NaOH in a buret and
slowly adding it to the solution of HCl while monitoring the mixture’s
pH. As discussed below, a visual indicator—an organic dye, such as
methyl red, whose color varies with pH—is often added to the titration
mixture. The color of the titration curve shows the change in the
indicator’s color during the titration.</p>

<div id="equivalence-points-and-endpoints" class="section level4">
<h4>Equivalence Points and Endpoints</h4>
<p>A titration’s equivalence point is the pH and volume where the moles
of titrand and the moles of titrant are the same. A strong acid, such as
HCl, has a pH below 7. As we add a strong base, such as NaOH, the pH
increases but remains below 7 if HCl is in excess. The pH rises above 7
when the moles of NaOH exceeds the moles of HCl. When the pH is 7, the
moles of NaOH added is the same as the moles of HCl initially present;
this is the equivalence point.</p>
<p>If we know the equivalence point’s pH, then we can titrate to this pH
and record the volume; this is, however, a rare circumstance. Instead,
we either continue the titration until the pH levels off and identify
the equivalence point as the volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, where the slope of the titration curve
reaches its greatest value, or we use a visual indicator that changes
color at a pH close to the equivalence point. The photograph on the
lower right, for example, shows the color of methyl red in (a) its red,
weak acid form at a pH &lt; 4.2 and (c) its yellow, weak base form at a
pH &gt; 6.3. and (b) for pHs values between 4.2 and 6.3 where the
indicator is present in both its acid and its base form, and is orange;
this is called the titration’s endpoint. In a well-designed acid-base
titration, the difference between the equivalence point’s volume and the
endpoint’s volume is small.</p>
