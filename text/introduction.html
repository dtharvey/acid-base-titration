titration is a quantitative analytical method in which we determine the
concentration of an acidic or a basic analyte—the titrand—by the
controlled addition of a strong base or a strong acid—the titrant—until
the acid and the base react in a known stoichiometric ratio.</p>

<h4>Titration Curves and Visual Indicators</h4>
<p>The figure on the upper right is a titration curve for the reaction
of a strong acid titrand, HCl, with a strong base titrant, NaOH. It was
recorded by placing the NaOH in a buret and slowly adding it to the
solution of HCl while monitoring the titration mixture’s pH. As
discussed below, a visual indicator—an organic dye, such as methyl red,
whose color varies with pH—is often added to the titration mixture. The
color of the titration curve shows the indicator’s color during the
titration.</p>

<h4>Equivalence Points and Endpoints</h4>
<p>A titration’s equivalence point is the pH and volume where the moles
of titrand is equal to the stoichiometric moles of titrant. The volume
of titrant needed to reach the equivalence point is the critical
measurement in a titration. A strong acid, such as HCl, has a pH below
7. As we add a strong base, such as NaOH, the pH increases but remains
below 7 if HCl is in excess. The pH rises above 7 when the moles of NaOH
exceeds the moles of HCl. When the pH is 7, the moles of NaOH added is
the same as the moles of HCl initially present; this is the equivalence
point.</p>
<p>If we know the equivalence point’s pH, then we can titrate to this pH
and record the volume; this is, however, a rare circumstance. Instead,
we either continue the titration until the pH levels off and identify
the equivalence point as the volume, <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span>, where the titration curve’s slope,
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{\Delta \text{pH}}{\Delta V}\)</span>,
reaches its greatest value, or we use a visual indicator that changes
color at a pH close to the equivalence point. The photograph on the
lower right, for example, shows the color of methyl red in (a) its red,
weak acid form at a pH &lt; 4.2 and (c) its yellow, weak base form at a
pH &gt; 6.3. and (b) for pHs values between 4.2 and 6.3 where the
indicator is present in both its acid and its base form, and is orange;
this is called the titration’s endpoint. In a well-designed acid-base
titration, the difference between the equivalence point’s volume and the
endpoint’s volume is small.</p>
