<p>The upper panel of controls define the conditions—concentrations and
volumes—for the titration of a weak acid or a weak base titrand using a
strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK slider to select the
strength of the titrand. The sliders for concentration are logarithmic;
the titrand’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} = 0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the
titrant’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-0.7}
= 0.2 \text{ M}\)</span>. The lower panel of controls defines the range
of volumes to use when displaying the titration curve and selects the
indicator. The color of the titration curve mimics the indicator’s color
during the titration. The indicator’s endpoint is defined here as the
average of its acidic and basic limits.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe how the titrand’s p<span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span> or p<span class="math inline">\(K_b\)</span>, its concentration and volume, and
the titrant’s concentration affect the shape and position of the
titration curve along the <em>x</em>-axis and the change in pH at the
equivalence point. Not all combinations of these variables will yield a
useful titration curve. Are the effects the same when titrating a weak
acid and titrating a weak base?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Which indicators are suitable for the
titration of a weak acid with a strong base when [titrand] = [titrant] =
0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider range of
concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a weak base with a strong
acid.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. When we use an indicator to signal the
endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the
absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration
curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the
titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the
equivalence point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10<sup>-3</sup> M?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic
acid, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{CH3COOH}\)</span>, that typically
is 4–8 %w/v. Propose a set of conditions—volume of vinegar, molarity of
NaOH, and acid-base indicator—that will allow you to determine the
concentration of acetic acid. All titrations should have endpoints
between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.</p>
