<p>The upper panel of controls set the conditions—concentrations and
volumes—for the titration of a weak acid or a weak base titrand using a
strong base or a strong acid titrant. Use the pK slider to the strength
of the titrand. The sliders for concentration are logarithmic; the
titrand’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-1} =
0.10 \text{ M}\)</span> and the titrant’s default concentration is <span class="math inline">\(10^{-0.7} = 0.2 \text{ M}\)</span>. The lower
panel of controls sets the range of volumes to use when displaying the
titration curve and selects the indicator. The color of the titration
curve mimics the indicator’s color during the titration. The indicator’s
endpoint is defined here as the average of its acidic and basic
limits.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>. Describe how the titrand’s p<span class="math inline">\(K_a\)</span> or p<span class="math inline">\(K_b\)</span>, its concentration and its volume,
and the titrant’s concentration affect the shape and position of the
titration curve along the <em>x</em>-axis and the change in pH at the
equivalence point. Not all combinations of these variables yield a
useful titration curve—it is easy, for example, to overshoot a
titration’s equivalence point if it requires just a few mL of titrant—so
make note of how limitations on one variable may depend on the values of
other variable. Are the effects the same when titrating a weak acid and
titrating a weak base?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>. Which indicators are suitable for a
titration of a weak acid with a strong base using [titrand] = [titrant]
= 0.10 M? Are there indicators that are useful across a wider range of
concentrations? Repeat for the titration of a weak base with a strong
acid.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 3</strong>. When we use an indicator to signal the
endpoint, we usually do not record the titration curve itself. In the
absence of suitable indicator, however, we must record the titration
curve by measuring the pH of the titration mixture as we add the
titrant. Is the change in pH sufficient to allow you to identify the
equivalence point when [titrand] = [titrant] = 10<sup>-3</sup> M?</p>
<p><strong>Exercise 4</strong>. Vinegar is a dilute solution of acetic
acid, <span class="math inline">\(\ce{CH3COOH}\)</span>, that typically
is 4–8 %w/v. Propose a set of conditions—volume of vinegar, molarity and
volume of NaOH, and acid-base indicator—that will allow you to determine
concentration of acetic acid. All titrations should have endpoints
between 20.0 mL and 40.0 mL.</p>
