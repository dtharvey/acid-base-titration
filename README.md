# acid-base-titration
 
This module introduces students to acid-base titrations with a focus on the titration of strong acids and bases, the titration of monoprotic weak acids and bases, and the titration of diprotic weak acids and bases. Students can explore the affect of the titrand's acid/base strength, concentration, and volume, and the titrant's concentration on the shape of a titration curve. The use of a visual indicator for locating endpoints also is considered.
